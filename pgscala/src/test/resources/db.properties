#  We need a valid database to connect to in order to test pgscala functionality.
#  To create a dummy role and database for testing, run the following commands as the postgres superuser:
#
#  CREATE ROLE pgscala PASSWORD 'changeit' LOGIN;
#  COMMENT ON ROLE pgscala IS 'Test role for PGScala';
#  CREATE DATABASE pgscala_test OWNER pgscala ENCODING 'utf8' TEMPLATE template1;
#  COMMENT ON DATABASE pgscala_test IS 'Test database for PGScala';
#
#  To delete the dummy database and role at a later time, run the following cleanup:
#
#  DROP DATABASE pgscala_test;
#  DROP ROLE pgscala;

host     = localhost
port     = 5432
dbname   = pgscala_test
user     = pgscala
