#  We need a valid database to connect to in order to test pgscala-util functionality.
#  To create a dummy role and database for testing, run the following commands as the postgres superuser:
#
#  CREATE ROLE pgscalautil PASSWORD 'changeit' LOGIN;
#  COMMENT ON ROLE pgscalautil IS 'Test role for PGScalaUtil';
#  CREATE DATABASE pgscalautil_test OWNER pgscalautil ENCODING 'utf8' TEMPLATE template1;
#  COMMENT ON DATABASE pgscalautil_test IS 'Test database for PGScalaUtil';
#
#  To delete the dummy database and role at a later time, run the following cleanup:
#
#  DROP DATABASE pgscalautil_test;
#  DROP ROLE pgscalautil;

host     = localhost
port     = 5432
dbname   = pgscalautil_test
user     = pgscalautil
password = changeit
